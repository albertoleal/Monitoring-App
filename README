## MONITORING APP:

	This is just another way to create monitoring points within your web applications.

## HOW TO:
	To start clocking the time you need to invoke the "addStartTime" function with the process name.
	When you want to stop clocking, just invoke the "addEndTime" with the same process name which you used to start clocking.
	
	<script type="text/javascript">
		CookieIntraOrder.addStartTime({processName:'the_process_name'});
		...
		...
		...
		CookieIntraOrder.addEndTime({processName:"the_process_name"});
	</script>
